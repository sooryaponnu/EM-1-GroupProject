             SPOTTED OWL
              
            </h1>
            <h4>Habitat</h4>
            
            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
              Over the full extent of their range, Spotted Owls occur in a variety of habitat 
              types centered around mature forests with dense canopies. The Northern Spotted Owl requires 
              unlogged, expansive, mature coniferous forest stands with large trees and a complex array of vegetation
               types, sizes and ages. This subspecies tends to avoid crossing clearcut, recently logged, or brushy areas
               , but will forage in redwood forests that have been previously logged if some old and large trees remain.
                The California Spotted Owl similarly prefers forest stands with large-diameter trees and varied levels
                 of vegetation. In areas up to about 3,300 feet above sea level, this subspecies lives among oak 
                 and other hardwoods; at higher altitudes it's more often found in conifers. The Mexican subspecies 
                 inhabits pine-oak forests or mixed-conifer forests dominated by Douglas-fir, pine, or fir. It also
                  roosts and nests in steep, narrow canyons.
            </p>
            
        
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">
            <div class="img-border">
             <img src="img/new.jpeg" alt="">

          </div>
          <h4> Food</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
            Spotted Owls eat mainly small and medium-sized mammals, especially rodents.
             The two dominant food items for both the Northern and California
              Spotted Owl are flying squirrels and dusky-footed woodrats; the Northern subspecies' 
              range is limited to areas where these two animals are available. Other common prey animals,
               some shared by all three subspecies, include bushy-tailed woodrats, mice, red tree voles,
                red-backed voles, snowshoe hares, brush rabbits, pocket gophers, and bats. Non-mammal 
                prey animals include smaller owls and other birds, amphibians, and insects. Spotted Owls 
                hunt mostly in the dark—starting as early as an hour before sunset, using several different 
                foraging sites in a single night, and stopping just before sunrise. The owls hunt from perches,
                 detecting prey by sight and sound. Gliding silently down on their quarry, they snatch it up in their talons.
                  These owls also capture prey in midair or pluck it from branches.
             <!-- They kill prey by breaking the animals' necks with their bills. <br>
            There, they live in the Western Ghats hills and mountains of southwestern India,<br> 
            where they live in tropical rainforests and on elevated mountainsides. -->
          </p>
          <h4> Nesting</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
            Spotted owls do not build their own nests, instead making use of cavities found in trees, deadwood,
             and snags, and the sites of abandoned raptor or squirrel nests. Some nest sites are used repeatedly.
              High-quality (consistently occupied and reproductive) breeding sites remain occupied after wildfire 
              and post-fire salvage logging, while lower quality sites that are inconsistently occupied and reproductive are more 
              likely to be abandoned after fire and salvage logging
               Spotted owls
             most often choose the same type of cover selected for nesting sites for daytime roosting
          </p>

          <h4> Breeding</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
            The spotted owl's breeding season occurs from early spring to late summer or fall,
             with prelaying behaviors such as preening and roosting together starting in February or March.
        Spotted owl pairs are monogamous and rarely re-nest after failed breeding attempts.
             The species does not normally breed every year, with average breeding probability being 62%. 
             Young owls may start breeding at an age of one year but two years or older is more common.
             Normal clutch size is two eggs but may reach four on rare occasions. 
             The female sits on the eggs and cares for the young, while the male provides food for them.
              Egg incubation times of about a month have been reported from western Oregon; time from fledging 
              to independence of chicks is between three and four months.Once independent, juveniles 
              disperse in late summer to fall, in the northern range often settling into a wintering range before seeking 
            out breeding territories in the spring. Dispersal range is often less than 19 mi (31 km).
          </p>

          <h4>Lifespan and mortality</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
            Spotted owls are long-lived and maximum ages of 16 or 17 years have been documented in the northern subspecies.
             The average annual survival rate is usually in excess of 80% for adults,
              although it is considerably lower for juveniles, which have an average 
              annual survival rate of 21–29%.[4] In New Mexico, the survival rate for fledgling Mexican spotted 
              owls can be as low as 11%. The most common causes of mortality are predation, starvation, 
              and possibly disease.
             Various birds and mammals such as the fisher (Pekania pennanti) are among the predators of eggs and young 
            spotted owls, Northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) crows may prey on juvenile spotted owls, 
            while great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and golden eagles
             (Aquila chrysaetos) are likely predators of both juveniles and adults. Great horned and barred owls 
             compete with spotted owls for food and space in some areas. Barred owls have
            a negative effect on northern spotted owl survival and fecundity
          </p>


          
          <h4>Behavior</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
            Though not especially swift, Spotted Owls are agile and maneuverable fliers, 
            interspersing gliding flight with quick wingbeats. Except when dispersing from natal territory,
             they don't tend to fly above the canopy or travel long distances. 
             Spotted Owls move up and down in the canopy to adjust to temperature changes, 
             which may be one reason they require the complex, multilayered vegetation provided by old-growth forests.
              Adult Spotted Owls are solitary except for interactions with their mates and young.
               They form long-term monogamous pair bonds, remaining year-round in the same home range. 
               Pairs begin roosting and interacting together 4–6 weeks before eggs are laid.
                Roosting owls frequently preen themselves and each other. The female incubates the eggs by herself, 
                leaving the nest only briefly during incubation to defecate, regurgitate pellets, defend the nest, 
                or receive food from the male. Around 8–10 days after the eggs hatch, she begins leaving the nest for progressively longer hunting forays. Young Spotted Owls remain in the nest for the first 4–5 weeks after hatching. Once out of the nest, they stay close to their parents for another 2–3 months, becoming independent by late summer. After reaching adult weight, 
            they disperse from their natal areas in September and October.
