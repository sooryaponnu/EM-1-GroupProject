                GREATER COUCAL
              
            </h1>
            <h4>Habitat</h4>
            
            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
                The Greater Coucal inhabits a variety of environments, typically favoring warm and tropical areas.
                 These birds are often found in dense undergrowth, especially in areas like scrub, mangroves, thickets,
                  and dense vegetation near cultivation and gardens. They adapt well to landscapes altered by humans, 
                  making them common in agricultural lands and village outskirts. These birds avoid very dense forests 
                  and are more commonly seen in open forest habitats. Their presence is widespread across Asia, 
                from India to Southeast Asia, adapting well to different environments within this range.
        
            </p>
            
        
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">
            <div class="img-border">
             <img src="img/coucal/coucal1.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
          </div>
          <h4> Food</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
            
              The Greater Coucal, a large bird in the cuckoo family, has a varied diet that includes a 
              wide range of foods. These birds primarily feed on insects, caterpillars, small reptiles, 
              frogs, and various small mammals. They are also known to eat bird eggs, nestlings, fruits,
               and seeds. The Greater Coucal is an opportunistic feeder and adapts its diet based on the
                availability of food in its environment. This dietary flexibility is one of the reasons why 
                it thrives in a variety of habitats, ranging from dense undergrowth to cultivated areas and gardens.






             <!-- They kill prey by breaking the animals' necks with their bills. <br>
            There, they live in the Western Ghats hills and mountains of southwestern India,<br> 
            where they live in tropical rainforests and on elevated mountainsides. -->
          </p>
          <h4> Nesting</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
           

                    Greater Coucals are unique in their nesting behavior compared to other cuckoo species,
                     as they build their own nests instead of being brood parasites. They typically construct
                      their nests in dense vegetation or thickets, often close to the ground. The nest is a deep
                       cup made of twigs, leaves, and grass. These birds usually lay 2 to 4 eggs, and both the male 
                       and female participate in incubation and rearing of the chicks. The nest, being quite large 
                       and loosely constructed, can sometimes be easily spotted in the undergrowth where these birds reside.


          </p>

          <h4> Breeding</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
             
                    The breeding season of the Greater Coucal typically varies depending on the region. 
                    In South Asia, for instance, it usually occurs during the monsoon season, from June
                     to September. During this time, these birds are more vocal and display courtship behaviors.
                      The male performs a display by fanning out its tail and strutting around the female. After
                       mating, both the male and female participate in building the nest, incubating the eggs, 
                       and feeding the chicks. The eggs are incubated for about 15 to 17 days, and the chicks
                        stay in the nest for several weeks before fledging. The nest is often a large, loosely
                         structured cup made from twigs and leaves, typically hidden in dense vegetation or bushes.
          </p>

          <h4>Lifespan and mortality</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
                     The specific lifespan of Greater Coucals in the wild is not well-documented, but like many bird species,
                      their life expectancy can be influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions,
                       predation, and disease. In general, larger bird species tend to have longer lifespans, and it's 
                       reasonable to assume that Greater Coucals, being relatively large birds, may live for several years
                        under favorable conditions. Mortality in young birds is typically higher due to predation and 
                        vulnerability before they become proficient fliers and foragers. Adult Greater Coucals may face
                         threats from predators, habitat loss, and human disturbances, though they are known for their
                          adaptability to changing environments.
          </p>


          
          <h4>Behavior</h4>
            
          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
          
            Greater Coucals exhibit several interesting behaviors. They are generally solitary birds or 
            are seen in pairs, and are not particularly shy, often allowing close approach by humans.
             They are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons. Their flight is labored and heavy, 
             and they prefer walking or hopping on the ground or among the undergrowth in search of food. These
              birds are known for their deep, resonant calls that are often associated with omens in many cultures. 
              They can be quite vocal during the breeding season. Their ability to adapt to habitats altered by human
               activity has helped them thrive in a variety of environments.

                    and invigorating environment for visitors.Covering a vast area, the sanctuary is spread across
                    a cluster of islands which are dotted with lush greenery and framed by the gently flowing river.

              <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
            Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary, established in 1984, is a vital conservation area located in the Thrissur 
            District of Kerala, India, covering approximately 85.067 square kilometers. As a part of the Western Ghats,
             a mountain range known for its exceptional biodiversity, the sanctuary is home to a wide array of flora
              and fauna, including several endangered species. The dense tropical forests of the sanctuary provide a 
              habitat for numerous species of plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, making it a biodiversity
               hotspot.The birdlife in Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary is particularly notable, with over 160 species of birds
                recorded, making it an ideal spot for birdwatchers to observe many endemic and rare bird species of 
                the Western Ghats. In addition to its rich avian diversity, the sanctuary also supports various mammal
                 species such as Asian elephants, leopards, Indian bison (gaur), sambar deer, and smaller mammals like 
                 the Indian giant squirrel. The vegetation of the sanctuary is characterized by tropical evergreen, 
                 semi-evergreen, and moist deciduous forests. This diverse vegetation not only provides a habitat for a
                  multitude of wildlife species but also contributes to the sanctuary's aesthetic appeal 
                  as a natural retreat.
