            <br>
            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
              Nestled in the lush landscapes of the Western Ghats in Kerala, 
              the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary stands as a haven for biodiversity and a 
              testament to conservation efforts. Established in 1973, this sanctuary spans approximately 391 square 
              kilometers and shares its borders with the Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu, collectively forming
               the Anamalai Tiger Reserve. Parambikulam is celebrated for its rich variety of flora and fauna, 
               including the majestic Bengal tiger. The sanctuary boasts diverse habitats, ranging from moist deciduous
                forests to semi-evergreen forests, providing a conducive environment for an array of wildlife species.
                 Elephants, gaurs, Indian leopards, and various species of deer roam freely within the sanctuary. 
                 The picturesque Parambikulam Reservoir, created by the Parambikulam Dam, further enhances the scenic
                  beauty of the region. The sanctuary is not only a crucial conservation area but also offers unique 
                  opportunities for eco-tourism, with activities such as trekking, bamboo rafting, and guided safaris 
                  allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the natural splendor while respecting the delicate balance
                   of the ecosystem.
